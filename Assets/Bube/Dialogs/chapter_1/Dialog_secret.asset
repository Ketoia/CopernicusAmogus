  Dialogs:
  - simpleDialog: Sznobic do you know why the device has a hexagonal grid?
    actorIndex: 0
  - simpleDialog: Well of course i do, you see... ehm. Hexagon is the strongest shape
      of course.
    actorIndex: 1
  - simpleDialog: But it wouldnt matter in this case, it could as well be made with
      a square grid like in chess.
    actorIndex: 0
  - simpleDialog: No no no Nicolaus, device isn't for play. Its purpose is to serve
      us in exploring universe secrets.
    actorIndex: 1
  - simpleDialog: From what book did you get that line? Okay if it cant be made like
      a chessboard, then what about triangles?
    actorIndex: 0
  - simpleDialog: Small pieces, it could be a choking hazard.
    actorIndex: 1
  - simpleDialog: For whom?
    actorIndex: 0
  - simpleDialog: Small babes, infants i suppose.
    actorIndex: 1
  - simpleDialog: We can barely get our hands on it, how could an infant get a hold
      of it?
    actorIndex: 0
  - simpleDialog: Nicolaus you are full of shit. Hexagon is the best of all shapes,
      what else would oh wise alchemists use for their device? Pentagons what a joke.
    actorIndex: 1
  - simpleDialog: If it where to use pentagons it would be three dimensional, that
      could have been interesting.
    actorIndex: 0
  - simpleDialog: Yes same with triangles, but its all bad. The device is as it is
      and God allmighty wouldnt allow anything else.
    actorIndex: 1
  - simpleDialog: You really like it all of a sudden.
    actorIndex: 0
