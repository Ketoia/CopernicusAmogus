  - simpleDialog: When it comes to studying, ive never told you how the device works.
      You were so preocupied you never asked wohohoho.

  - simpleDialog: Inside the device there is an universal glyph, made in a similar
      way to what you did back in the courtyard. Elemntal proxies we place on the
      board are precisely weight so that the gears inside rotate parts of the glyph
      to the desired elements.

  - simpleDialog: So its a more complex version of a scale right?
    actorIndex: 0
  - simpleDialog: Basically thats it. Hence come the constraints, the device is limited
      by the glyph placed inside. I think the gears inside will need some lubrication.
