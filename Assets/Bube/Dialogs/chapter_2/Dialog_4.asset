  - simpleDialog: Ah yes glyphs. Alchemists use them to direct the elements, magic
      some used to call it wohoho. The device somewhat replicates this effect, at

  - simpleDialog: Then what is so good about it?
    actorIndex: 0
  - simpleDialog: Good question wohoho. Constraints arent all bad, they challenge

  - simpleDialog: When you mention it, ive got an idea.
