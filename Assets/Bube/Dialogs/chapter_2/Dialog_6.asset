  - simpleDialog: Ive read some about glyphs, king Solomon used them to build his
      temple. How far does the alchemical practice go?

  - simpleDialog: Oh the story with summoning demons? Its a good one indeed. Alchemy
      goes back to even before written history, as long as people were looking at
      the sky in wonder there were practioners.

  - simpleDialog: Did they also use glyphs, and are there any records of it?

  - simpleDialog: So curious you are wohohoh. I think all that is left of it is word
      of mouth alone, stories, legends. Perhaps there were some records in the library
      of Alehandria, but tough luck finding it now wohoho.

  - simpleDialog: If they used your parchment it could have been avoided. Who could
      even fathom the magnitute of knowledge lost.

  - simpleDialog: If only wohoho, perhaps we were born into the wrong age, time will
      tell. Copernicus if you are so curious of the old practices we could try them
      out. Firstly for making glyphs we will need special chalk.

  - simpleDialog: Lead the way.
